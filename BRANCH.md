# Refactor Sphinx Theme

This branch focuses on refactoring the Sphinx theme to incorporate the design principles and hierarchical content handling from the old Grav theme.

## Goals

-   **Modernize the Theme:** Update the existing Sphinx theme to be more flexible and easier to maintain.
-   **Semantic Structure:** Create a clean, semantic HTML structure for all templates.
-   **Hierarchical Content:** Implement a system for pages to manage their own content as well as subordinate items, similar to the old Grav theme.
-   **Interactive Lists:** Generate lists of subordinate items as clean HTML to allow for flexible styling and interactivity.
-   **Generalized Ablog Functionality:** Make the time-based listing functionality of Ablog a default behavior for any page, not just blog posts.
